# Handwritten-Digit-Recogniser
This project demonstrates a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.  The trained model can recognize digits (0â€“9) not only from the MNIST dataset but also from handwritten images stored in a folder.
